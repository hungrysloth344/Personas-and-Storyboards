        <p id="intro" class="lead">The goal of the Personas and Storyboards assignment is to step into a user's shoes to
            observe
            real users interacting with an interface, interview these individuals about their experiences, create
            personas based on these users, and illustrate a storyboard for one the personas.<br><br>Selected accessible

            The problem that the interface is trying to solve is the ease and ability to
            register for and select courses at Brown. The key components include the sign in button, which allows you to
            sign in to your Brown account, a search bar to find specific courses, and drop down and check boxes to
            filter through classes.

                    <li><span>All users have used C@B at least once before and thought it was easy to add and remove

                    Annoyed Abby is a junior at Brown University looking for an easy WRIT course. She
                    is annoyed at having to open new tabs for each class's Critical Review to look at the average
                    number of hours spent on the class. The persona represents users who are more familiar with C@B and
                    uses filters to look for specific classes. It also represents users looking to view statistics on
                    classes
                    since Annoyed Abby is opening tabs for each class to view statistics while filtering through WRIT
                    courses.

                    Curious Carl is a freshman at Brown University looking for a First Year Seminar to register for. He
                    is rushing to find classes that still have spots available before registration opens up so that he
                    can register and get a spot in a first year seminar. The persona represents users who are not as
                    familiar
                    with the interface and do not know how to use filters to look through classes because Curious Carl
                    is unsure of how to use C@B efficiently with filters, thus he is manually searching for specific
                    classes to register for.
